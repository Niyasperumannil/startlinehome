              Henge furniture is characterized by convenience, comfort and
              functionality. There are no fancy details in it, the color scheme is
              calm. Such Italian furniture does not draw attention to itself, but
              only complements the interior. Henge sofas can easily “adjust” to
              changes in the design of your home. In the production process of Henge
              furniture are used environmentally friendly and natural materials:
              quality leather, noble woods, natural fabrics and fillers.
